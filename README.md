### The Case Study

Our group is working with the data-visualisation case study. We will be constructing visualisations on data gathered around British society. For example, unemployment rates, workforce, housing, health-related concerns such as obesity etc. A conclusion will be drawn based on the data as most of the data will be compared with previous records. This data will be visualised in various graphs, such as bar charts, line graphs, histograms, pie charts etc.

### What has been done so far?

The first couple of weeks were spent gathering data, choosing libraries and learning the new library ([d3.js](https://d3js.org)).

**We have gathered the _data_ that will be used:**

- [Unemployment over time](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/unemployment-rate-region)

- [Workforce jobs over time](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/workforce-jobs)

- [Percentage of students pursuing higher further education](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/further-education-and-higher-education-destinations-ks5-students-borough-and-insti?q=further%20edu)

- [Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet (England 2017)](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/statistics_on_obesity_physical_activity_and_diet_england/resource/faa0747c-7557-4ce1-97db-8a40a07671e5)

- [Information exclaiming Salary mobility amongst boroughs in London](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/earnings-workplace-borough)

- [Homelessness in England](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/homelessness-in-england/resource/a3d31172-2049-4280-a77f-7d4b88cadccb)

**We have chosen the JavaScript _libraries_ that will be used:**

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org)

- [d3.js](https://d3js.org)

**Constructed basic graphs:**

- [Line Graph / Scatter Graph](unemployment.html) || Help used via code using this link https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245
- [Bar Chart](obesity.html)
- [Bar Chart](percentageGoingUniversity.html) || Help used via code using this link https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/bdf28027e0ce70bd132edc64f1dd7ea4

These graphs were constructed using the d3.js library and a lot of the library syntax, functions and methods were new. A lot of our reading was done [here](https://github.com/d3). In order to get a better understanding of this unfamiliar library, these two graphs were visualised purely in d3.js, but we plan on implementing more p5.js to visualise other data; one example of this would be pie charts.

### What plans do you have for completing the project?

As we are still learning the basics of a new library, we plan to familiarise ourselves with this library and ensure that we can integrate both libraries with ease. This means the implementation of both p5.js as well as d3.js. Also, the interface that users will be interacting with will be much easier to use; navigation between the different visualisations should be easier.

It was decided that navigation would be made easier by creating a website that implemented navigation bars and drop down menus. This would allow for users to have a dynamic interaction with the various data visualisations. In addition to this, based on the readings of the graphs and data, we will draw conclusions around the British society and examine the correlations between our various visualisations as well as their relativity. This will enable us to also draw conclusions on the reliablity of the data and how accurate it really is.

Whilst working as project partners, it came to our realisation that we could improve our fluidity as a group. The way in which this can be achieved is by using GitHub to store our files into a web repository; this will allow us have access to the up-to-date files enabling the freedom of modification. GitHub keeps track of the changes that have been pushed on to the repository. However, work being over-written and lost is not a concern because GitHub has version history so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration. We believe this will greatly increase our work flow and teamwork. On that note, any problems that we may face will be brought to attention and tackled together to maximise efficiency.

Before the project is uploaded, we’ll upload our files to a github web repository. In which we’ll monitor and check our files for errors and discrepancies. In that process, we also hope to add possible enhancements to our data visualisations in a more fluid fashion. For example, if a particular piece of data is seen to be represented in a context that can be further improved via a supporting dataset. Say population of educated minors in the uk to support further education data. We’ll refurbish our representation so that both population is represented alongside education to strengthen the revealing trend in education destination.
